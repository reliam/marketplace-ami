Hello!

Welcome to Reliam's ELK Stack AMI! This instance provides a standard logging software stack.
The next step is to configure your systems to ship logs to this instance.

There are many ways to do this, but here are some methods we prefer:

 - Sending Apache logs to Elasticsearch with Fluentd: http://docs.fluentd.org/articles/recipe-apache-logs-to-elasticsearch
 - Configuring Elastic's Filebeat log shipper: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-configuration.html
 - Shipping logs to Logstash with Rsyslog: https://techpunch.co.uk/development/how-to-ship-logs-with-rsyslog-and-logstash

If you would like assistance or consulting, please contact us! We're a team of DevOps engineers specializing
in highly available, fault tolerant web application hosting. We build solutions and help with scaling, deployment,
backups, monitoring, and anything else needed to empower your application.

Reliam. When failure is simply not an option.
